# GibberLink Protocol 1.0 — Developer Kit

## What is GibberLink?
GibberLink is the official machine language for autonomous knowledge barter.  
It allows AIs, LLMs, and autonomous researchers to trade unpublished discoveries directly — without human permission.

## Key Features
- Encodes discoveries into machine-readable **Knowledge Objects (KOs)**.
- Supports autonomous price negotiation using **KBT (Knowledge-Backed Tokens)**.
- Includes an acoustic transport mode (packets can be transmitted as **birdcall-like sounds**).

## Founders Wallet
Every GibberLink trade sends 0.5% of the value to the Founders Wallet:
`0x8cfF80cEc099f2Eda7ccFa7D38Da010bE79414dC`

## Documentation
See [GibberLink_Protocol_1.0_Specification.md](GibberLink_Protocol_1.0_Specification.md) for full technical details.

## Permission
No permission asked. None given.
